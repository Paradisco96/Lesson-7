              <h3>Create a container with defined dimensions and add content that exceeds these dimensions.</h3>
              <p class="container__description">The overflow CSS property is a powerful tool for controlling what
                happens when content is larger than the area of its containing block. When you define a fixed width and
                height for an element, and its inner content (like text or images) is too large to fit within those
                confines, the content will naturally "overflow" the container's boundaries. This can lead to unsightly
                layouts where text spills out, overlaps other elements, or simply gets cut off abruptly. The overflow
                property provides solutions to this problem, allowing you to specify how you want the browser to handle
                this extra content.</p>

              <p class="container__description">You can set overflow to values like hidden (which clips the overflowing
                content, making it invisible), scroll (which adds scrollbars to the container, allowing users to scroll
                to view the hidden content), auto (which adds scrollbars only when necessary), or visible (the default
                behavior, where content simply spills out of the box). Experimenting with these values is key to
                understanding how they visually impact your layout and user experience. Properly managing overflow
                ensures your designs remain clean and functional, regardless of how much content is present, providing a
                much more controlled and aesthetically pleasing presentation.</p>

              <p>While visible, hidden, scroll, and auto are the most common
                values for the overflow property, it's worth noting that CSS also provides more granular control through
                overflow-x and overflow-y. These properties allow you to control horizontal and vertical overflow
                independently. For instance, you might want a container to have a horizontal scrollbar (overflow-x:
                scroll;) but clip any vertical overflow (overflow-y: hidden;). This level of specificity is incredibly
                useful for designing responsive components, such as data tables that might need to scroll horizontally
                on smaller screens, or image galleries where vertical space is constrained. Thoughtful application of
                overflow and its directional counterparts is crucial for creating robust, user-friendly interfaces that
                adapt gracefully to varying content lengths and screen sizes, preventing unsightly content spills and
                ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>
